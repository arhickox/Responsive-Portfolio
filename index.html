      <p>Hello! My name is Austin Hickox and I am an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer. I am currently taking a boot camp at
        Georgia Tech University to see this dream realized. I graduated from Indiana University in 2016 with a Bachelor's
        Degree in Informatics and a minor in Business. I worked for two years for KPMG, one of the Big Four accounting firms.
      </p>
      <p>I was born in Kansas City, KS and moved to several states before settling in Atlanta, GA at the age of 10. I like to
        read, swim and watch television. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and have attended Dragoncon every year since my first
        in 2009.</p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to getting as much as I can from this class. I see it as an opportunity to create things, which
        I have always enjoyed doing.</p>
